# Deep Learning for Face Mask Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for the classification of face images into two categories: with or without a face mask. The primary goal is to build an accurate and robust face mask classification model that can contribute to efforts in public health and safety.

## Key Features

- **Dataset:** The project utilizes a dataset containing images of individuals with and without face masks. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure diversity and representation.

- **Deep Learning Model:** Implement a deep learning model, possibly using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to effectively classify face images based on the presence or absence of a mask.

- **Training and Evaluation:** Train the model on the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset Preparation:** Ensure the face mask dataset is properly formatted and contains labeled images for training and evaluation.

2. **Model Training:** Run the provided scripts or notebooks to train the deep learning model. Experiment with hyperparameters and model architectures to optimize performance.

3. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using the evaluation metrics.
